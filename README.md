Since my previous microservice project (https://github.com/spiegelberger/PhotoApp-microservice) is now somewhat outdated,
and the Udemy course on which the project was based has been also reworked by Sergey Kargopolov 
(https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-and-spring-cloud/), I decided to create a more modern version of my project for practice.
